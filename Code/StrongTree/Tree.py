'''
In this class we create a structure to hold the classification/regression tree.
We need following requirements:
    0- An easy way for user to create the tree
    1- The set of branching nodes
    2- The set of Leaves
    3- For each node we need to get the index of left/right children and the parent

In this class we assume that we have a complete binary tree; we only receive the depth from the user
